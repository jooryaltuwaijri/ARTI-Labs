# ARTI-Labs

This repository is used for hands-on practice with GitHub workflows and basic lab organization.

## Purpose
- Practice GitHub Flow (branches, commits, pull requests)
- Organize lab work in a clear, structured way
- Track changes and iterations across labs

## Notes
- Each lab is kept in its own folder.
- Commits reflect incremental changes and cleanup.
- This repository is for learning and experimentation, not production use.

---

Feel free to explore the labs and review the commit history to follow the workflow.
