# Lab 1: Git & GitHub for ML Projects

Hello! My name is Joori Altuwaijri.

I am a student majoring in Cyber Security and Data Forensics, with an interest in learning how machine learning can be applied to security, data analysis, and digital investigations. I am eager to build a strong foundation in version control and collaborative development using Git and GitHub.

This repository was created as part of Lab 1 for ARTI 308 – Machine Learning and is used to practice the GitHub Flow, including creating repositories, editing README files, and committing changes.

I look forward to learning more about machine learning throughout this course.
